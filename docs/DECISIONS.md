# Decisions

Every design decision, the alternative rejected, and why. Newest at the bottom. Dates are London
time.

## 2026-09-06 — Repository is a direct clone of upstream, not a fork

The brief assumes a fork. Claude cannot create a fork under the operator's GitHub account (never
touches the operator's accounts), so the repo is a clone of `advitrocks9/aichessathon-starter`
with upstream as `origin`. The operator can fork on GitHub and run
`git remote set-url origin <fork-url>` at any time; nothing else changes.

## 2026-09-06 — Engine name "Mikhail LeTal", package `mikhail_letal`

Chosen by the operator (a pun on Mikhail Tal). Python packages must be lowercase identifiers, so
the folder is `mikhail_letal`; `ENGINE_NAME = "Mikhail LeTal"` is the display name. Verified
that `import mikhail_letal` fails on the bare interpreter and the name is not in
`sys.stdlib_module_names`, so the zip-first `sys.path` cannot shadow anything. Rejected: `ferz`
(Claude's first pick, replaced at the operator's request), anything generic like `engine` or
`chess_engine`.

## 2026-09-06 — Stage 0 is a python-chess engine, not a numba engine

Alternative: go straight to the numba engine (Stage 1). Rejected because the brief's first
priority is a valid, non-flagging submission from the first session; python-chess provides a
proven legality oracle and rules implementation, so Stage 0 correctness risk is confined to our
search, evaluation and time management. Stage 1 replaces the hot path and keeps python-chess in
the wrapper as the oracle.

## 2026-09-06 — Position keys are python-chess's `_transposition_key()`

Alternatives: Zobrist hashing via `chess.polyglot.zobrist_hash` or our own Zobrist. Rejected for
Stage 0: `zobrist_hash` walks every piece (slower), and our own Zobrist needs incremental update
inside python-chess's push/pop which we do not control. `_transposition_key()` is a tuple of the
bitboards plus turn, castling rights and en passant square; it is exactly what
`Board.is_repetition` uses, so our repetition detection agrees with the referee by construction.
It is a private name, so a python-chess upgrade could break it; the platform pins 1.11.2, which
has it. Stage 1 replaces it with our own Zobrist keys inside the jitted engine.

## 2026-09-06 — Transposition table is a Python dict with a hard entry cap (Stage 0 only)

The brief's §6.4 asks for fixed-size numpy arrays; that belongs to the numba engine. In pure
Python a dict is far faster than numpy indexing per probe. The cap (`tt_max_entries`) bounds
memory; when reached the table is cleared, which is crude but safe (the alternative, an aging
replacement scheme, is Stage 1 work). Memory is measured, not assumed (see RESULTS.md).

## 2026-09-06 — Piece-square tables come from a parametric geometric prior, never from memory

Risk: a language model writing an engine may reproduce tables it has seen (Sunfish's tables are
famous and Sunfish is a house bot). Decision: `tools/gen_pst.py` computes every entry from named
geometric formulas (centrality, advancement, shelter squares) with a small parameter dict, prints
the tables for inspection and records provenance in `weights/pst.json` and
`weights/PROVENANCE.json`. Piece values start at the textbook 100/320/330/500/900 and are
recorded as textbook values. Any later tuning (Texel, Stage 2) records script, data hash and run.

## 2026-09-06 — Mop-up term instead of tablebases in Stage 0

KX-vs-K must convert without Syzygy. The term rewards pushing the bare king to the edge (its
centre-Manhattan distance) and bringing our king close (14 minus the king distance); the two
weights are ours (`mopup` in `pst.json`). The idea is textbook geometry; the constants were chosen
by us and are not copied. Syzygy 3–4-man is a Stage 2 experiment with its own arena run.

## 2026-09-06 — Two-fold repetition in search is scored as a draw

A search node whose position has occurred before (in the game history from the first FEN, or on
the current search path) scores `DRAW_SCORE`. This makes the engine avoid repeating when its
evaluation says it is ahead and seek repetition when behind, with no separate root rule.
Alternative rejected: only detect true threefold — it wastes the search's ability to steer away
before the third occurrence and is what loses won games in shuffling endgames.

## 2026-09-06 — No null-move pruning or late-move reductions in Stage 0

Both are on the Stage 1 list. Stage 0 optimises for correctness and a measured baseline; every
pruning technique will be added as a separate experiment with an arena result, so the report can
show what each one is worth here.

## 2026-09-06 — Time budget formula and constants are the brief's §6.2, uncalibrated

`overhead_ms = 150` and the other constants are the brief's initial values, held in one dataclass
(`TimeParams`). They are replaced after the first validation log per `docs/CALIBRATION.md`.

## 2026-09-06 — Test suite uses pytest (dev dependency only)

Added `pytest` to the `dev` dependency group in `pyproject.toml` via `uv add --dev`. Nothing in
`tests/` or `tools/` ships. `[tool.mypy] files` was extended to `mikhail_letal`, `tools` and
`tests` so `make gate` type-checks everything we write.

## 2026-09-06 — Opening collection is light-touch and cached

`tools/collect_openings.py` follows the brief's §7.1: one request per second, descriptive
User-Agent, stop on the first error, only paths `robots.txt` allows, every page cached under
`data/cache/` so the run happens once. Sampled ~80 of the 335 teams and capped game pages at 400.

## 2026-09-06 — Parallel development by several agents against a written contract

Stage 0's five modules were written concurrently by separate agents from `docs/DESIGN.md`, then
integrated and reviewed. The contract is the reason the pieces fit; any later change to a
signature is made in DESIGN.md first.
